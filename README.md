# Novaduino_Environment_Sensors
Using a Novaduino color Display, an ENS160 and a BME280 sensor, you can see your air quality (TVOCs, eCO2), temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure.
Keep track of your surroundings using this advanced sensor software, perfect for creating smart home setups or DIY weather stations. Instantly view the carbon dioxide levels in your room along with various Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), such as ethanol, toluene, hydrogen, and other oxidizing gases. These readings are combined to give you an Air Quality Index (AQI) indicator. The kit also measures temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure, displaying all results on the Novaduino® 2.4” touchscreen color display powered by open-source software on an Arduino-compatible Feather processor. Because the system is open source, you can add more sensors and personalize the display.

Please see novaradiolabs.com for purchasing the hardware.

With provided assembly instructions and free Arduino software, getting started is straightforward.

You'll need to download Arduino C code from GitHub and do some soldering and mechanical assembly.

This developmental hardware and software are provided as uncalibrated and are not intended for use in critical applications. The Environmental Sensor is not designed for safety-related, medical, or end-product purposes. It is offered solely for educational and experimental use, with no warranty or guarantee for any other application.

The AQI, VOC, and eCO2 sensors require at least 48 hours of burn in before values are stable.
